## Syllabus


__Professor:__ Laura Toma (she/her)

__Class time:__  TR 2:50-4:15
__Classroom:__  Searles 126



**Prerequisites:** csci 2200 (Algorithms) and csci 2330 (Systems). In other words, basic knowledge of:

-  analysis (asymptotic notation, growth, recurrences)
-  basic algorithms and data structures (searching, sorting, binary search trees, priority queues) and algorithm design techniques (divide-and-conquer, greedy)
- programming in C/C++
- Unix terminal commands and Makefiles


**Overview:**




Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an umbrella term for systems
  that work with geographically referenced, or geospatial data such as
  maps and subdivisions, networks, points, surfaces and aerial
  imagery.  Routine tasks include visualizing multiple layers and
  types of data; performing surface analysis such as drainage and
  watersheds, visibility, gridding, interpolation and contouring;
  performing data exploration and spatial statistics; location
  analysis; and image processing of remote sensing imagery. GIS have
  long become indispensable tools in the earth, atmospheric and
  oceanographic sciences and their uses keep growing as more data is available. 

From a computer science perspective, GIS and geospatial data provide a
rich source of algorithmic problems. Furthermore these problems require efficient solutions
that work well in practice and scale up to large data.

This class explores algorithmic problems in GIS. Topics include
contour lines and contour trees, drainage, watersheds, flooding,
modeling sea level rise, visibility, line simplification and surface
simplification, LiDAR data, Delaunay traingulations, Voronoi diagrams,
B-trees, quadtrees, parallel processing with OpenMP, cache-efficient
algorithms, cache-efficient matrix multiplication and space-filling
curves. This is a projects course --- the class will provide
opportunities to implement and experiment with some of these
algorithms.


**Learning objectives:** 

- Understand  fundamental problems encountered in GIS and their
  algorithmic solutions

- Understand the importance of algorithm design, complexity analysis
  and generally the interplay between theory and practice

- Gain coding skills in C/C++  and work on a large project

- Improve communication skills by give a presentation and write a paper 





**Syllabus overview:**

The list below is tentative and  very likely to change to best fit our needs. 

- Data models (vector and raster; TINs; TIN representation)
- Contour lines
- Modeling sea-level rise
- Drainage: aspect, slope, flow accumulation, watersheds, sink-watershed partition, flooding and pfastetter labeling
- Visibility: line-of-sight, viewshed, total viewshed
- Parallelization with OpenMP 
- Lidar data; classification; lidar-to-raster and lidar-to-TIN
- Line simplification and surface simplification.
- Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagrams. 
- Spatial indexing: B-trees,  Quadtrees and R-trees
- Spatial operations:  nearest neighbor and k-nearest neighbors
- Space-filling cuves: Z-order and Morton order


 
**Communication:** Class communication will be entirely on Slack. You
  will need to monitor Slack for class updates, including possible
  cancellations or delays. The code to join Slack is posted on Canvas.

     
 
**Course requirements:**


The requirements for the class are as follows: attendance and active
engagement during classes and completion of projects and other
assignment. 

Evaluation will be as follows: 

- __Class engagement: 20%__ 
- __Projects: 80%__


Noe that class engagement will significantly affect your grade. What
 does __class engagement__ mean?  Examples of class engagement
  include: attending class; consistently and independently engaging in
  discussions, volunteering answers, making observations, talking to
  your group and classmates about the material; and engaging on Slack.
