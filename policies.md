### Late Policy
As we will continuously build upon what we have discussed, it is
crucial that you do not fall behind on assignments. The due dates in
place are meant to help you stay on target.

We will follow a flexible due date policy in which you may turn in an
assignment up until three days (72 hours) after the deadline with a
penalty of 5% per day.  Assignments will not be accepted more than
three days late. Submit what you have before that time, even if it
does not work as you would like.


### Religous holidays
If a religious holiday interferes with a deadline, please be in touch with me.

### Emergencies
If you have serious circumstances that will impact
your ability to learn, please be in touch as soon as possible so that
we can make a plan. Please only _serious_ circumstances (for
e.g. taking two classes with homework deadlines the same day does not
count as a serious circumstance).



### Re-grade Policy 

You can request a re-grade within seven days of receiving your
grade. You should do this only if you believe that I have made an
error in grading, not simply because you woud like a higher grade (for
e.g., I took points off for a feature that is missing, when in fact
the feature was there in the code and I missed it).



### Project  Collaboration  Policy

All projects are partner-optional.  You and your partner(s) will work
together on the assignment throughout the whole process, you will
write it and review it together, and will submit one assignment. The
assignment must be a true joint effort, equally owned, created and
understood by both partners. Specifically splitting the assignment and
working on the problems separately is not allowed and violates the
honor code for the class.


- __Pair programming policy:__ If you chose to work with a partner,
you must work together, physically in the same place, for the entire
project that you do together. The overall project must be a true joint
effort, equally owned, created and understood by both
partners. Specifically splitting the problem into parts and working on
them separately is not allowed and violates the honor code for the
class. If you start together as a team and are unable to complete the
project together, then you will each inherit teh shared code, and
split up to work individually on the remainder of the project. You
would then submit individually, with a note on what happened.  There
are many advantages to working with a partner (e.g. more fun, more
learning, good skill for the "real world"), and I encourage you to
try. You may also consider alternating between working alone and with
a partner, and changing partners.


- __Collaboration across teams is at level-1:__ that is, verbal
  collaboration without solution sharing. You are allowed and
  encouraged to discuss ideas with other class members, but the
  communication should be verbal and additionally it can include
  diagrams on board. Noone is allowed to take notes during the
  discussion (being able to recreate the solution later frommemory is
  proof that you actually understood it). Communication cannot include
  sharing pseudocode for the problem. Please read the department's
  collaboration policy.


Remember that you are responsible for reading, understanding, and
adhering to the department's [collaboration
policy](https://turing.bowdoin.edu/dept/collab.php). If you have any
questions about any aspects of the policy, please do not hesitate to
ask for clarification.
